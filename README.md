## BigQuery - SQL queries for NYC Open Data
Practice working with Google BigQuery while using NYC Open Data to answer questions such as the longest CitiBike ride, how dangerous it is to ride a bike in New York (very, especially in BK!), and which addresses get the most noise complaints in myy neighborhood. 

## Comment Analyzer 
NLP early work into the numerical analysis of sentiment of my own teacher comments. Identification of good and bad comments as well as NMF for topic modeling from several years of comments. 

## Bootcamp, Graduate School, Job Application Tech Assessments. 
Various types and styles of questions I've been asked for technical assessments for admission and interviews. I've learned a lot from working on these and even more from reviewing them periodically.
